    "This project sets out to simulate traffic levels between junctions 6 and 7 on the m50 for four weeks during the month of October 2023. I will seek to establish how traffic levels are related to whether the day is a weekday or weekend, how traffic is distributed on average over a 24 hour period, and how the distribution of northbound traffic compares with southbound traffic.\n",

    "To carry out this analysis, I have downloaded the monthly volume report for this traffic October 2023 from the site https://trafficdata.tii.ie/calendar_alt.asp?sgid=XZOA8M4LR27P0HAO3_SRSB&spid=130DE8EB2080. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is of interest to me, as I currently travel on the m50 to work five days per month, and a better understanding of how traffic levels are distributed on the m50 would help me better plan my commute. I chose the area between junctions 6 and 7 as it strikes me as a busy area of the m50 during my commute."
