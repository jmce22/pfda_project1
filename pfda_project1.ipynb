    "### Introduction ###\n",
    "\n",
    "This project sets out to simulate traffic levels between junctions 6 and 7 on the m50, based on an analysis of four weeks of traffic data taken during the month of October 2023. I will seek to establish how traffic levels are related to whether the day is a weekday or weekend, how traffic is distributed on average over a 24 hour period, and how the distribution of Northbound traffic compares with that of Southbound traffic. I also wish to investigate whether a relationship exists between local air temperature and the volume of traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this project, however, is to create synthetic datasets of the variables we have selected, and to have them match as closely as possible the data as it exists in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/M50_looking_north_at_Castleknock_flyover.jpg/3264px-M50_looking_north_at_Castleknock_flyover.jpg\" alt=\"Junction 6 M50 Northbound\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain traffic data, I downloaded the monthly volume report for this traffic for October 2023 from the Transport Infrastructure Ireland \n",
    "site https://trafficdata.tii.ie/calendar_alt.asp?sgid=XZOA8M4LR27P0HAO3_SRSB&spid=130DE8EB2080. I used the data for Southbound and Northbound traffic volumes for the 4-week period from Monday 2nd October to Sunday 29th October. Traffic here refers to all kinds of vehicles - cars, lorries, caravans, buses, motorbikes and vans, but, for the period analysed, cars made up roughly 77% of the total traffic, with vans accounting for a further 13%.\n",
    "https://trafficdata.tii.ie/tfreport.asp?sgid=XzOA8m4lr27P0HaO3_srSB&spid=130DE8EB2080&reportdate=2023-10-02&enddate=2023-10-29&dimtype=2\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the relationship of local air temperature with traffic levels, I used hourly data for air temperature for the nearby Phoenix Park weather station, for the period 2nd October to 29th October inclusive. https://data.gov.ie/dataset/phoenix-park-hourly-data \n",
    "\n",
    "I manually compiled the data I wanted to use from both source files into a CSV file which I saved into my repository for this project. I also created a column called \"day_type\" to allow me to split my sample by weekday and weekends, as I was curious to test how traffic levels were distributed according to that variable. In addition to this compiled CSV file, I have saved the raw source data files into my repository for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is of interest to me as I currently travel on the m50 to work five days per month (Southbound in the morning, Northbound in the evening), and having a better understanding of how traffic levels are distributed on the m50 might help me to plan my commute better. I chose to analyse the area between junctions 6 and 7 as it strikes me as a busy area of the m50 during my commute. I am also curious to test what impact changes in a weather variable, such as air temperature, might have on other peoples' behavior, with regard to their decision to drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before setting out my project, I should caveat my findings by emphasising that the distributions of traffic I measured are taken from October 2023 only and that the long run distributions for traffic levels are likely to deviate over time from those I measured (eg. due to holiday periods or events like very bad weather or the recent pandemic). Therefore, my simulated datasets for traffic levels are likely to deviate in the long run from the distributions that exist in the real world. Nevertheless, I feel this is an interesting dataset to practice "
