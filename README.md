## Introduction ##

This repository contains my submission for Project 1 for the Programming and Scripting module of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics from ATU. This project involves choosing a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which we can collect at least 100 data points and 4 variables, analysing the variables involved and synthesising a dataset to closely match the proprties of the real world dataset.

I used Visual Studio Code (version 1.84.2) to write my scripts and to upload them to a repository on GitHub for assessment.

I completed my project using Jupyter Notebook, ran through VS Code. I saved my project as a .ipynb file.
