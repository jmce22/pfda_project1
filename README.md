## Overview ##

This repository contains my submission for Project 1 for the Programming and Scripting module of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics from ATU. This project involves choosing a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which we can collect at least 100 data points and 4 variables, analysing the variables involved and synthesising a dataset to closely match the proprties of the real world dataset.

I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code - version 1.84.2), to write my scripts and to upload them to a repository on GitHub for assessment.

I completed my project using Jupyter Notebook, ran through VS Code. I saved my project as a .ipynb file.

Libraries I used to complete my project are matplotlib, numpy, pandas, seaborn and scipy.stats.


### How to execute my script ###

- Open VSCode. Go the search bar at the top and type '>'. 

- Search for Git: Clone.

- Select Clone from GitHub and press Enter.

- When prompted for the Repository URL, select clone from GitHub, then press Enter.

- Sign into Github, if prompted to.

- Enter the URL "https://github.com/jmce22/pfda_project1" into the repository field.

- Select which directory on your machine you would like to clone my repository to.

- Select "Open" when asked if you want to open the cloned repository.


My project is contained within the file "pfda_project1.ipynb". 

Other files found in my repository include:
- saved .png files from the real-world dataset
- examples of .png files which plot synthetic data
- my manually compiled source CSV file which I used to create the main dataframe for my project
- the CSV files downloaded from trafficdata.tii.ie and data.gov.ie which contain the raw data used in this project
- a gitignore file
- this README file

To execute my script on VS Code:
- open the file "pdfa_project1.ipynb" 
- click the 'Run All' button at the top of the screen.

This should cause the script to run; new plots should be saved for the synthetic data, saving over the plots initially saved down.
